## Introduction

### What is `.bashrc`?

The `.bashrc` file is a script that is executed every time you start an interactive Bash shell. It allows you to customize your shell environment by setting various configurations, environment variables, and defining shell functions. It is typically located in your home directory (`~/.bashrc`).

### What is `.bash_aliases`?

The `.bash_aliases` file is a user-specific script that allows you to define custom aliases for frequently used commands in Bash. Aliases are shortcuts that substitute a longer command with a shorter alias, making it easier and faster to execute common tasks. By using the `.bash_aliases` file, you can organize and manage your custom aliases separately from the main `.bashrc` file.

### Why would you use `.bash_aliases`?

The use of `.bash_aliases` offers several advantages:

- **Simplified command execution:** You can define short and memorable aliases for complex or lengthy commands, saving time and reducing typing errors.
- **Customization and personalization:** `.bash_aliases` allows you to personalize your shell experience by creating aliases that match your workflow and preferences.
- **Easy maintenance:** By separating aliases into the `.bash_aliases` file, you can easily manage and update your aliases without modifying the main `.bashrc` file.

In this class, we will explore the concept of Bash aliases and how they can enhance your command-line experience.
