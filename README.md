# Kyle Spicer's Github Classes

## About 
I embarked on my programming journey in April 2022 when I started the 170D Warrant Officer Basic Course. Prior to that, I had no formal experience with computers or programming theory.

Throughout the course, I had the privilege of learning from exceptional instructors and collaborating with talented peers. However, I encountered a challenge when it came to recalling and effectively sharing the vast amount of information I had absorbed. To address this issue, I initiated the creation of this repository to document the valuable insights I have gained in a concise and accessible manner.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a resource where I can share the practical and insightful lessons I have learned, making them easily digestible for others who may benefit from them.
